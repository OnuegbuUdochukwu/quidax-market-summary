# Quidax Market Summary API ðŸ“ˆ

A Spring Boot REST API that provides a 24-hour summary for each market on Quidax, including the 24h percentage price change, trading volume, and high/low prices.

## Features

- Provides a clean, summarized list of all active markets.
- Calculates the 24-hour price change percentage for each market.
- Uses BigDecimal for all financial calculations to ensure precision.
- Built with a clean, layered architecture (Controller, Service, DTO).

## Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3
- Maven
- Lombok
